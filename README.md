**Note**
- This app is built using Commerce.js v2 SDK

## Overview

This README will guide you in getting up and running with a fully-fledged eCommerce template. We have configured this template for you to one-click deploy directly to Netlify. Alternatively, you can manually deploy to your choice of hosting platform.

For a full detailed tutorial on building this JAMstack eCommerce application, please head on over [here](tutorial-url).


## Prerequisites

- IDE or code editor of your choice
- Node (v8.2.0 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Chec CLI `yarn global add @chec/cli`

## Setup

### Create a Chec account. 

Now that you‚Äôve installed Chec CLI globally, you will be able to access the list of `chec [COMMANDS]`, one of which is registering for a Chec account. Let‚Äôs go ahead and get that set up!

```bash
# Open the Chec registration page in your browser
chec register
```

Follow the rest of the walk-through to set up your merchant details. Alternatively, you can go [here](https://authorize.chec.io/signup) to register for a Chec account. 


## One-click Deploy with Netlify (recommended)

The one-click deploy allows you to connect Netlify to your GitHub account to clone the `commercejs-nextjs-demo-store` repository and deploy it automatically. Be sure to go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) and sign up for an account before clicking the deploy button.

 [![Deploy to Netlify button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/chec/commercejs-nextjs-demo-store)

By clicking the above button, you will be navigated to the Netlify‚Äôs direct deploy page with the project‚Äôs repository passed as parameters in the url. Click the **Connect to GitHub** button, name your repository and enter in this [public key](https://github.com/chec/commercejs-nextjs-demo-store/blob/master/.env.example#L2) in the **Chec Public Key** input. Please note that for the purpose of getting you up and running with a live deploy preview of the demo store, we provided you with the Public Key from our demo merchant account. Now, save & deploy your site.


## Manual setup and Netlify deployment

Manual setup involves cloning the repo into your local environment, seeding the provided sample data into your Chec account and deploying to Netlify.

**STEP 1.** Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository locally, optionally rename the repo, change into the directory
git clone https://github.com/chec/commercejs-nextjs-demo-store.git chec-store 
# Change into the directory and install dependencies
cd chec-store && yarn
```

**STEP 2.** Set up your environment variables

Replace the sample `.env.example` dotenv file at the root of the project to store your Chec `public_key` as well as your `secret_key`.

```bash
# Copy from source file to destination file .env
cp .env.example .env
```

You can access your API key under in your Chec dashboard setup, then navigate to the Develop tab to copy your Public Key and Secret Key. Replace the provided `CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY` with your own and fill in your `CHEC_SECRET_KEY` in the `.env` file. The secret key is necessary for the seed script to have the proper permission to seed the sample data in `/seeds` into your Chec account. Remove the secret key once the data is seeded.

```js
// .env

# Fill in your public key and secret key
CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY=
CHEC_API_URL=https://api.chec.io
# Secret key is used with chec/seeder to access your Chec account to seed it with sample data
CHEC_SECRET_KEY=
NODE_ENV=
```

This file is meant to not be committed to source control and also will be hidden in file browsers.

**STEP 3.** Seed the data necessary to power your Chec store and start your development environment
```bash
# Seed data in /seeds into your Chec account
yarn seed
# Run your development environment on http://localhost:3000
yarn dev
```

Now head on over to http://localhost:3000 after starting your development, your site should now be populated with the sample data!Your site should now be populated with the sample data!

**STEP 5.** Make any necessary changes you need and push the code to a repository on Github or your choice of platform.

**STEP 6.** Deploy your site

Be sure to sign up for a Netlify account and log in to it. Click the **New site from Git** button and give access to select your repo. Your build settings are automatically filled out for your from the `netlify.toml` in the template. To enter your environment variables, click **Show advanced** then **New variable** and fill in the key input as CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY and the value input with your Public Key. You can access your API key in your Chec dashboard under Setup, then navigate to the Developer tab to copy your Public Key

Now go ahead and click the "deploy site" to see your live site!
